Things I have learnt making this project:
- managing an application using multiple activities,
- creating navigation drawer,
- creating custom ListViews,
- receiving data from external APIs using volley library,
- working on JSONObjects and JSONArrays,
- managing SharedPreferences,


Since it was my first bigger application and I've been learning a lot of features in the mean time, I see now many thing I need to change. Application is not considered as finished and I'm still contributing new features and rewrite some of existing.

Thing I'm changing now or want to change soon:
- create a class containg tv shows data to avoid using many lists containing the same data,
- reduce number of volley calls,
- implement gson to make JSON calls more readable and easy to deal with,
- learn more about xml and implement material design,
- create a xml template to SearchActivity results,
- add feature to present more info about upcoming episodes while clicking particular position on Upcoming list,
